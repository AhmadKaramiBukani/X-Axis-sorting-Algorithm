# X-Axis-sorting-Algorithm
This fast linear algorithm was coded in C# by the algorithm designer, Ahmad Karami Bukani from Rojhalat Kurdistan.

This article examines three algorithms for sorting random numbers according to statistical frequency, which, by examining these algorithms, suggests an optimal method for large and bulky data, and these algorithms are implemented using C# programming language and explained.

There are various sorting algorithms whose complexity is O(n^2) or exponential O(2^n) or logarithmic O(logn base2), but in my proposed algorithms that it is based on the concept of mathematical Cartesian xaxis, the set of negative and positive numbers are sorted, this algorithm has a time and memory complexity of linear degree or O(n) and is faster than a number of other sorting algorithms.
All sorting algorithms have their own time complexity and memory complexity, and since the amount of memory of today's computers is increasing and the solving time of my proposed sorting algorithm is linear O(n), in my opinion, the higher priority is to consume more memory but to get the answer faster, in any case, when it takes time to sort, my preference is to use an algorithm that consumes even more memory but the sorting is done in a shorter time, all three algorithms Sorting is a statistical operation that also calculates the frequency of random numbers
